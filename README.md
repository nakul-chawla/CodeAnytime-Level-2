# CodeAnytime-Level-2

At least one hour of coding, daily, is a must for any student enrolled in a Computer Science and
Engineering course, regardless of whether he/she is new to coding or has been coding for the past 3-4
years. 

It’s best if this hour is supplemented with comrades who are on the same journey so that the
people in the group hence formed, can help one another and learn new skills and concepts from one
another. 

It is with this vision that the “Code Anytime” initiative has been launched by UPES ACM and
ACM Women Student Chapters.

Then initiative will not only set up an environment that will encourage students to code more
and more, but also promote inter-networking among the participants. It will help with senior-junior
interactions as well as inter-branch interactions and will make the campus a more connected place.

## Process
Anyone can shoot a message in any WhatsApp group when they are free and want to code, with
their location; and others who are free will join them, promptly
The idea is to utilise free time productively, instead of wasting it away

The students would be divided into 3 tiers:
- Level 1 – Learning from scratch
- Level 2 – Having basic knowledge
- Level 3 – Having advanced knowledge, preparing for competitions like ICPC
 
 *The tiers would only be so that a student can give others information about his level of
command over programming, at present, and students can collaborate accordingly
